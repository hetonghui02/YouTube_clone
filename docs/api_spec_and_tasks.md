## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry of the application, should be implemented last"),
    ("templates/index.html", "Contains the HTML structure of the webpage, should be implemented first"),
    ("static/css/styles.css", "Contains the styles for the webpage, should be implemented after 'templates/index.html'"),
    ("static/js/dark_mode.js", "Contains the JavaScript code for switching to dark mode, should be implemented after 'static/css/styles.css'"),
    ("docs/index.rst", "Contains the documentation of the project, should be updated continuously during the project")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "templates/index.html",
    "static/css/styles.css",
    "static/js/dark_mode.js",
    "main.py",
    "docs/index.rst"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'index.html' contains the main structure of the webpage. It uses Bootstrap for styling.
'styles.css' contains the CSS code for the webpage. It includes the styles for both light and dark mode.
'dark_mode.js' contains the JavaScript code for switching to dark mode. It changes the color scheme of the webpage.
'main.py' contains the main entry of the application. It uses Flask to serve the webpage and handle the requests.
'index.rst' contains the documentation of the project. It is written in Chinese using Sphinx.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me. However, we need to confirm the exact functionalities that need to be implemented in 'main.py'. Also, we need to decide on the database to be used for storing the videos and user data.
