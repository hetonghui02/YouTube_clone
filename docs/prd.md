## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Vimeo: A video-sharing platform similar to YouTube, but with a focus on high-quality content. Its homepage features a curated selection of videos, but lacks the personalized recommendations of YouTube.",
    "Dailymotion: Another video-sharing platform. Its homepage is similar to YouTube's, with a mix of recommended and trending videos. However, it doesn't have a sidebar for subscriptions and playlists.",
    "Twitch: Primarily a platform for live streaming, especially video games. Its homepage features live streams and recommended channels, but doesn't have the same variety of content as YouTube.",
    "Bilibili: A Chinese video-sharing platform. Its homepage is similar to YouTube's, with recommended videos, categories, and a sidebar. However, it also includes features like bullet comments, which may not be suitable for all users.",
    "Youku: Another Chinese video-sharing platform. Its homepage is more cluttered than YouTube's, with a mix of videos, ads, and other content."

## UI Design draft
The webpage should have a clean and intuitive design, similar to YouTube's homepage. At the top of the page, there should be a search bar and a navigation bar with different categories. Below this, there should be a list of recommended videos. On the left side of the page, there should be a sidebar with subscriptions and playlists. The webpage should also have a switch for turning on dark mode, which changes the color scheme to darker tones for comfortable browsing in low light conditions.
